# Depression_detection

This repository presents a machine learning model developed to identify depressed individuals from Reddit data. The project involves scraping data using the Reddit API, applying NLP techniques for data preprocessing, and exploring various algorithms such as SVM, KNN, and Logistic Regression. The performance of each model is assessed, and the Logistic Regression model is identified as having the highest accuracy. Through this project, the goal is to detect mental health indicators from text data and provide insights into depression identification using NLP techniques.
